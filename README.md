This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It demonstrates a common error: the potential for `ZeroDivisionError` when the list is empty.  The solution shows how to gracefully handle both empty lists and cases where the sum of numbers is zero.

The `bug.py` file showcases the potential issue, while `bugSolution.py` offers a robust solution using proper error handling.
